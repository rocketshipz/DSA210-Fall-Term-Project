# *Investigating the Relation between AI Assistant Usage and Academic Performance among Undergraduate students*
## **Project Description:**
This project aims to explore the correlation between students’ use of AI-based learning tools and their academic performance. With the increasing integration of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and other study-related applications in students’ daily routines, understanding how these tools influence learning outcomes has become crucial.

We aim to answer the question: "Does higher AI Assistant Usage rate contribute to higher Academic Performance?" In order to do this, we conduct end-to-end data analysis, which begins with cleaning and transforming raw data before moving on to hypothesis testing and predictive modelling utilizing classification and regression techniques. Findings from this project will provide insights into the role of AI in education and its implications for digital learning behavior among high school students, whether it will have a positive or negative impact on students' performance. 

## **Motivation:**
The rapid and widespread adoption of generative AI assistants has created a significant challenge and opportunity in academia, especially at the university level. While some people argue that AI can enhance learning, critical thinking, and efficiency, others warn of potential negative consequences, such as reduced academic integrity and over-reliance. This project provides a quantitative analysis to guide institutional policies and educational methods about AI integration, addressing the pressing need for the study of data to go beyond hypothetical discussions.

## **Data Analysis Plan** 
### **1. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Displayed summary statistics and distributions for all key variables (AI_Usage_Rate, FinalScore, StudyHours, etc.).
- Generate a histogram or boxplot to show the distribution of variables.
- Generate a correlation matrix and heatmap to visualize relationships among variables.
- Generate a scatter plot to observe linear relationships.

### **2. Hypothesis Testing**
- **H₀ (Null):** There is no significant relationship between AI usage and academic performance.
- **H₁ (Alternative):** There is a significant relationship between AI usage and academic performance.

## **Expected Outcomes**
- Understanding the relationship between AI Assistant Usage and Academic Performance of Undergraduate Students.
- Presenting insights through visualizations and statistical findings.
- Applying data science techniques to derive meaningful conclusions.
