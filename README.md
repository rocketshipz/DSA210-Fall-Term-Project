# DSA210-Fall-Term-Project
# **Investigating the Relation between AI Assistant Usage and Academic Performance among High School students**
## **Project Description:**
This project aims to explore the correlation between students’ use of AI-based learning tools and their academic performance. With the increasing integration of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and other study-related applications in students’ daily routines, understanding how these tools influence learning outcomes has become crucial.

Through correlation and regression analysis, the project seeks to determine whether higher AI engagement is associated with improved academic results or if excessive dependence may negatively affect study effectiveness. Findings from this project will provide insights into the role of AI in education and its implications for digital learning behavior among high school students.
